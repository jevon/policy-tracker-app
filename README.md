## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google AI API Key (for Gemini)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jevon/policy-tracker-app.git
cd policy-tracker-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Generate the comparisons (requires Gemini API key):
```bash
npm run generate-comparisons
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Updating Comparisons

When you want to update the policy comparisons:

1. Make sure your `.env` file has the Gemini API key
2. Run the comparison generator:
```bash
npm run generate-comparisons
```
3. Review the generated files in `public/data/comparisons/`
4. Commit the changes to the repository

### Building for Production

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy!

Note: The comparison data is generated locally and committed to the repository. The Vercel deployment will use the pre-generated comparison files, so no API calls are needed during deployment.
